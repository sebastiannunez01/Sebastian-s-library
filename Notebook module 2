Boolean logic is a system that deals with binary variables and the logical operations. It typically operates on two values, it is usually denoted as true and false(1 and 0). It also includes three fundamental options, AND, OR, and NOT. These can be combined to create more complex logical expressions. Booleans always represent true or false, when you compare two values the expression is evaluated and python returns the boolean answer.
 Equal (==): Use it to see if two values are equal. Example. ‘a == b’ will see if the a variable is equal to the value of the b variable.				Not equal(!=): Use it to see if the value of two variables are not equal. Example ‘x != y ‘ will see if the value of x is not equal to the value of y.		Greater than( >): It checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand. Example ‘ a > b ‘ this checks if the value of a is greater than b	Less than( <): It checks to see if the left operand is less than the right operand. Example: ‘ x < y ‘ checks if the value of x is less than the value of y	Greater than or equal to(>=): This checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to right operand. Example ‘a >= b ‘ will see if A is greater than or less than B.											Less than or equal to(<=): This function checks to see if the left operand is less than or equal to the right one. Example. ‘ x <= y ‘ will see if x is less than or equal to y.
The if statement is used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true 											x=20												if x>12:											print(“x is greater than 12”)
The elif statement is used to check additional conditions if the preceding”if condition is false. It stands for “else if”								z=30											if z > 40 										print( “ z is greater than 40”)				                               elif z > 30:							                               print(“z is greater than 30 but not 40”)
The else statement is used to specify a block of code to be executed if the preceding if and elif statements are false					y = 8											if y > 10										print (“ y is greater than 10”)							elif y > 6										print (“y is greater than 6 but not 10”)						else: (“ print y is 7 or less”)
    Combining all of these statements would be easily applicable in a coding for grades. You could list the numerical value of the grade of a student. Then list if it’s above a 90 it’s an A, above an 80 and lower than a 90 a B and etc. all the way down to F.
